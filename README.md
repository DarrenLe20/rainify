# Rainify

A Vite React app that leverages Openweather API and Spotify API to recommned music based on ambience analysis of the current weather at the user's location.

Hosted on Github Pages: https://darrenle20.github.io/rainify/

Note: The app is designed with phone browser in mind (it looks ugly on computers/tablets)
